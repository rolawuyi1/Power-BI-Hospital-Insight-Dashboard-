# Power-BI-Hospital-Insight-Dashboard-


📊 Executive Summary – Hospital Analytics Dashboard
Overview
This project leverages Power BI to analyze hospital performance data from 1,000 patients across five hospitals. The interactive dashboard provides actionable insights into treatment costs, diagnoses, recovery outcomes, and doctor performance. The goal is to optimize treatment strategies, improve patient recovery, and enhance hospital resource efficiency.

🛠 Tools & Skills Used
Power BI – Created dynamic visualizations and an interactive reporting dashboard.
Data Analysis – Explored patient demographics, treatments, and outcomes to derive insights.
Statistical Insight – Identified patterns and relationships between treatment types, recovery ratings abd cost.
Healthcare Knowledge – Interpreted data with an understanding of clinical operations and care delivery.

📂 Dataset Description
Data was sourced from two Excel sheets covering patients and hospital staff.
This data enables analysis of medical, financial, and operational aspects of hospital care.

❓ Business Question
How can hospitals reduce treatment costs while improving or maintaining recovery outcomes across patient treatment types?

🔍 Key Insights & Recommendations
1. Treatment Cost Analysis
Insight: Surgery is the most expensive treatment per patient.

Recommendation: For applicable cases, consider using counseling, medication, or physical therapy, which tend to have lower costs and comparable recovery ratings.

2. Recovery Rating by Treatment Type and Cost
Insight: Expensive treatments such as surgery do not consistently result in higher recovery ratings.

Recommendation: Focus on cost-effective treatments like counseling, which deliver strong recovery outcomes at a lower cost.

3. Number of Patient by Treatment Type 
Insight: Diabetes exhibits the highest number of patient 

Recommendation: Prioritize diabetes care through targeted treatment plans and preventive programs to improve outcomes and reduce long-term costs.

4. Diagnosis Volume and How well They recover Overtime 
Insight: Peaks in patient admissions align with seasonal diagnosis patterns.

Recommendation: Use these trends to better plan staffing, bed capacity, and supply allocation during high-demand months.

5. Doctor Workload Analysis
Insight: A small number of doctors are managing a disproportionately large share of patients, suggesting an imbalance in workload distribution among the medical staff.
Recommendation: Balance patient assignments across doctors to prevent burnout and maintain quality of care. Consider redistributing cases or hiring support staff where needed.



✅ Action Plan for Stakeholders

1. Optimize Treatment Protocols
   
Focus on high-recovery, low-cost treatments (e.g., counseling, physical therapy).
Review and revise current treatment strategies to avoid overuse of surgery where alternatives exist.
2. Use Admission Trends for Planning
   
Monitor admission peaks by month and diagnosis.
Align staffing, beds, and supplies with anticipated demand to prevent resource strain.
3. Evaluate Surgery Alternatives

Pilot lower-cost treatments for conditions commonly treated with surgery.
Measure outcomes to determine scalability across hospitals.
